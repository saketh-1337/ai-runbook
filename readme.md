## Usage

1. **For Security Teams**: Use this repository to standardize and document your security operations procedures for AI-assisted workflows.

2. **For Developers**:
   - Edit content only in the `rules_bank/` directory
   - Never edit files through the symlinks in AI tool directories
   - Use the provided Python scripts for configuration if needed

3. **For AI Assistants**: The symlinked `rules_bank` directory in each tool's configuration folder provides access to all personas, runbooks, and documentation.

## Integration

This project is designed to work with:
- Chronicle SIEM
- SOAR platforms
- Google Threat Intelligence (GTI)
- Security Command Center (SCC)
- Various MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools

## AI Tool Integration

This repository is designed to work with three AI coding assistants:

### Claude Code (claude.ai/code)
- Uses the `.claude/` directory for configuration
- Reads context from `.claude/rules_bank/` symlink
- See `CLAUDE.md` for Claude-specific guidance

### Cline
- Uses the `.clinerules/` directory for configuration
- Reads context from `.clinerules/rules_bank/` symlink
- Follows the same runbook and persona system

### Gemini CLI
- Uses the `.gemini/` directory for configuration
- Reads context from `.gemini/rules_bank/` symlink
- See `GEMINI.md` for Gemini-specific guidance
- Compatible with the same documentation structure

### Quick Start for AI Tools

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dandye_ai_runbooks
   ```

2. The symlinks should already be set up. Verify they exist:
   ```bash
   ls -la .claude/rules_bank
   ls -la .clinerules/rules_bank
   ls -la .gemini/rules_bank
   ```

3. If symlinks are missing, create them manually:
   ```bash
   # For Claude Code
   mkdir -p .claude
   ln -s ../rules_bank .claude/rules_bank

   # For Cline
   mkdir -p .clinerules
   ln -s ../rules_bank .clinerules/rules_bank

   # For Gemini CLI
   mkdir -p .gemini
   ln -s ../rules_bank .gemini/rules_bank
   ```

### Using with AI Tools

Each AI tool will automatically read the context from its respective directory:
- **Claude Code**: Reads from `.claude/`
- **Cline**: Reads from `.clinerules/`
- **Gemini CLI**: Reads from `.gemini/`

All three tools access the same content through symlinks, ensuring consistency.

### Symlink Architecture

The project uses a symlink-based system to share the same content across all three AI tools:

1. **Master Content**: All documentation, personas, and runbooks are maintained in `rules_bank/`
2. **Symlinks**: Each AI tool's configuration directory contains a symlink to `rules_bank/`
3. **Benefits**:
   - Single source of truth for all content
   - Updates automatically propagate to all AI tools
   - No duplication or synchronization needed

### Configuration Scripts

- `set_persona_rules.py`: Configure active personas (legacy - may need updates for new structure)
- `symlink_common_steps.py`: Manage common steps symlinks (legacy - may need updates)
- `configure_mcp_tools.py`: Configure MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for Claude Desktop

## Example Runbook Invocation Prompts

Use these realistic prompts to invoke various security runbooks. All examples use real data extracted from the `reports/` directory:

### Alert Triage
```
Please execute the alert triage runbook for SOAR case 2194.
```
The case involves repeated authentication failures for user F.K. on host A.S.L from IP 10.1.0.4. Check for duplicate cases and perform initial entity enrichment.

### IOC Enrichment
```
Run the basic IOC enrichment runbook for the suspicious domain scarfponcho.com.
```
Threat intelligence analysis and SIEM correlation for a domain which was flagged in our environment.

```
Execute IOC enrichment for the file hash de96a6e69944335375dc1ac238336066889d9ffc7d73628ef4fe1b1b160ab32c found on host WINS-D19.
```
This was associated with PowerShell obfuscation activity by user LISAWALKER.

### Case Investigation
```
Perform a comprehensive case investigation for SOAR case 3480.
```
 This is a critical priority case involving PowerShell attacks on WINS-D19, potential data exfiltration via BigQuery, and GCP exploitation attempts. Focus on the 17 associated alerts.

### Detection Rule Analysis
```
Analyze detection rule ru_99d1f620-3fe2-41d5-918e-0e1bd2402065 (ursnif_malware_dns).
```
 I need rule validation, tuning recommendations, and analysis of recent detections for this high-severity rule.

### Threat Hunting
```
Execute the IOC threat hunt runbook for IP addresses 46.8.9.205, 46.8.9.206, and 46.8.9.207.
```
These IPs are associated with the malicious domain scarfponcho.com and need comprehensive SIEM analysis.

```
Run the advanced threat hunting runbook focusing on lateral movement techniques (PSExec, WMI) around host WINS-D19.
```
This follows the PowerShell attack activity discovered in case 3480.

### Malware Triage
```
Perform malware triage for the sample with hash de96a6e69944335375dc1ac238336066889d9ffc7d73628ef4fe1b1b160ab32c.
```
This was involved in the PowerShell obfuscation incident on WINS-D19.

### Suspicious Login Analysis
```
Execute the suspicious login triage runbook for authentication events involving user F.K. on host A.S.L from source IP 10.1.0.4.
```
This is related to case 2194 with multiple failed followed by successful logins.

### Incident Response
```
Initiate incident response for compromised user account in case 3480.
```
Multiple indicators suggest account compromise including PowerShell obfuscation and potential data exfiltration.

### Cloud Security Analysis
```
Run the cloud vulnerability triage runbook for the BigQuery exfiltration alerts in case 3480.
```
Focus on the DLP context and Google Drive data movement patterns detected by SCC.

### Endpoint Isolation
```
Execute the basic endpoint triage and isolation runbook for host WINS-D19.
```
This system was compromised in case 3480 with PowerShell attacks and potential malware execution.

### Deep Dive Analysis
```
Perform a deep dive IOC analysis on domain scarfponcho.com using GTI collections.
```
Include malware family associations, campaign attribution, and infrastructure analysis.

### Summary
These examples demonstrate how to invoke runbooks with specific, actionable intelligence that mirrors real security operations scenarios.
